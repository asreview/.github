# Beep Beep, ELAS here

Welcome to the ASReview project, glad to see you here! :wave:

My name is ELAS, your **E**lectronic **L**earning **As**sistant, and overall mascot of ASReview.
This GitHub organization is my home üè°, let me show you around!

## This is ASReview
First stop, the heart of my home is the ASReview repository, the source code of ASReview LAB and the place where I actually get to help you! 

You can dive into the history and see where it all started (but you have to go back a long while üïµÔ∏è)!
