First things first, welcome to the ASReview Universe 🪐. The ASReview Universe consists of many many things, but on the whole, it is a research project conducted at Utrecht University. It uses state-of-the-art active learning techniques to solve one of the most interesting challenges in screening large amounts of text: there’s not enough time to read everything! Part of the universe is ASReview LAB, **free and open source software** for screening large amounts of textual data in a smarter way 🤓. 


### 👐 Open Source

The best part about ASReview LAB? It is completely free, installed locally, and open source:

Open source means:
 - From fixing spelling mistakes to implementing your ideas, anybody can [contribute to the project](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
 - You can dive into the history and see where ASReview started (but you have to go back a long while 🕵️).
 - There is no black-box anymore ⬛, everything is transparent 👓.

Since we are talking about open source and free software anyway ☝️, please consider [giving ASReview a star ⭐](https://github.com/asreview/asreview) on GitHub. [Donations](https://asreview.nl/donate/) 💛 make sure that the software remains freely available to everyone, please help to keep it that way.
